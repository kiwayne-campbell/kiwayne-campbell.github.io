# kiwayne-portfolio

Basic portfolio created from the ground up.

Thought this would be fun to do rather than use a template.

In the future, I plan to overhaul this;

Learn some photoshop to create my own logo (only know basic photoshop right now)

And again, get to grips with great design- CSS really is soething that intrigues me, because looking at sites that use minimal design- I have a great appreciation for how difficult it actually is.
